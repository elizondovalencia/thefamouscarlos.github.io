#A Concept Redesign for Brushfire
##By Carlos Martinez

Hey! You already know me, but just a quick refresher: I'm a Senior Design Consultant and I work on making brands great.
So, here I present my vision of a future Brushfire website.
(This is a prespective on how I as a consultant view the world, please take no offense)

### Props
    - Churn preventing hero! No major hype, offering a demo of the product is perfect!
    - Clear copy, No frills BS and easy to read
    - Responsive Design
    - Genuien Reviews
    
### No nos'
    - Fake paralax! (WHY!)
    - Boring copy. While clear, its boring and feels to formal
    - Poor use of animations - poor animations in general
    - Out dated design. My first thought was - This is a Bootstrap site
    - No real order to the page. Testimonials are every where, icons all over the place etc...
    
So with this in mind lets make something great. Removing everything except 3 of the notes in the Props category.

## Concept
A clean, colorful, site that feels playful and has a genuien voice to it
We keep the hero clean with our request a demo button, but we add a mockup with a preview of our tool (abite it is fake in this case)
Next we have our 3 most important selling points of our tool, folowed 2 points in depth.
Later we show that we integrate with popular tools, and end with a few reviews.

### Copy and Visual Appeal
I stated earlyer that the site had clear UX copy, but it fell short in feeling playful and authentic, so I included a baseline UX copy idea in the page, its playful, clear, and honest, yet still sells the product clearly
The design is clean, driven by geometry, mostly circular and waves. It also has clean eye poping colors for quick attention drawing
All the icons are custom made in AI for the concept.

##Notes
    - All the icons were made by hand in AI with material design as the focus
    - The Dashboard images were from a previous project I made and is free for your use
    - SMACSS is the design archetecture, but BEM would be the best alternative if this is taken into production
    
## Closing thoughts
I meant it when I said that this project is free for your corporate use, I hope you enjoy it, truly! While I'm sad that I won't be the man that you hire this round I do hope to work with you in the near future. If you want to extend this project into something official and want to have me work on it, please do let me know, I love working with great brands.
In any case, Thankyou for the chance you gave me and I hope to hear from you soon!
P.D Please let me know what your people think of the concept, be it postive or negative! I want o better my skills and that feedback would help!
- Best,
Carlos M.
